  Keep the soil moist, water when it starts to dry. \
  Hanging and curling leaves are a sign of too little water. \
  Watering a little often, is better than a lot infrequently. \
  Misting is beneficial, especially in winter if the air is dry. \
  The edges of the leaves turn brown when misting too little.\
